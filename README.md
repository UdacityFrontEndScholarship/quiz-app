### Data Model

We have also prepare a data model for our application to show the data flow in the application so that anybody can understand and work on the application very easliy. [Here](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/d6d11adb-7d10-45bd-a5e0-997f20a19ba4/0?shared=true&) is the link to the data model.

### ER Diagram

Entity relation diagram is a good pictorial representation of the  database design for an application. This helps in designing backend easily. [Here](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/4959f428-f905-44ff-9a82-1cd55f6cf960) is the link to the ER diagram.
